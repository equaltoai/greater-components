# Contributing to Greater Components

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Greater Components! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to this project.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct, which promotes a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

This project uses the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) to ensure that all contributions are properly licensed. The DCO is a lightweight mechanism for contributors to certify that they have the right to submit their contributions under the project's license.

### What is the DCO?

The DCO is a statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution and agree to license it under the project's open source license (AGPL-3.0-only).

### How to Sign Your Commits

All commits must be signed off using the `-s` or `--signoff` flag:

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat: add new component"
```

This adds a `Signed-off-by` line to your commit message:

```
feat: add new component

Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

### DCO Text

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that

    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

   ```

## Development Workflow

### Code Style

- We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Run `pnpm lint` to check for linting issues
- Run `pnpm format` to format code
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled - ensure no type errors

### Testing

- Write tests for all new features
- Run `pnpm test` to run all tests
- Run `pnpm test:unit` for unit tests
- Run `pnpm test:e2e` for end-to-end tests
- Maintain minimum 90% code coverage

### Commit Messages

We follow the Conventional Commits specification:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Test additions or changes
- `chore:` Build process or auxiliary tool changes

Examples:
```bash
git commit -s -m "feat: add Button component with variants"
git commit -s -m "fix: correct focus trap in Modal component"
git commit -s -m "docs: update README with installation instructions"
```

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass and coverage requirements are met
2. Update documentation as needed
3. Add a changeset for your changes:
   ```bash
   pnpm changeset
   ```
4. Create a pull request with a clear description
5. Link any related issues
6. Wait for code review and address feedback

### Changesets

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for version management:

1. Run `pnpm changeset` when you make changes
2. Select the packages affected
3. Choose the version bump type (major, minor, patch)
4. Write a summary of your changes
5. Commit the generated changeset file

## Package Development

### Creating a New Package

1. Create a new directory under `packages/`
2. Add a `package.json` with proper configuration
3. Extend `tsconfig.base.json` for TypeScript config
4. Add exports to the package.json
5. Update the root `README.md` if needed

### Component Guidelines

For UI components:

1. Use Svelte 5 runes (`$state`, `$derived`, etc.)
2. Ensure full TypeScript typing
3. Include proper ARIA attributes
4. Write Storybook stories
5. Add comprehensive tests
6. Document props, slots, and events
7. Follow the design token system

## Accessibility

All components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards:

- Proper semantic HTML
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management
- Color contrast requirements
- Reduced motion support

## Security

- Never commit sensitive data
- Run `pnpm audit` regularly
- Report security vulnerabilities privately to security@equalto.ai
- Follow OWASP guidelines for web security

## Release Process

Releases are automated through GitHub Actions:

1. Changesets create a release PR
2. Maintainers review and merge the PR
3. GitHub Actions automatically publishes to npm
4. Tags and releases are created on GitHub
