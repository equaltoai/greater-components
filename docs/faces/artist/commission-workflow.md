# Artist Face: Commission Workflow

The artist face includes:

- A UI component: `CommissionWorkflow` (creative tools)
- Optional state helpers: `Patterns.createCommissionPattern` (TypeScript, not a CLI registry item)

```ts
import { CommissionWorkflow } from '@equaltoai/greater-components/faces/artist';
```

## CLI Install

The CLI installs components, not the face pattern factories:

```bash
greater add commission-workflow
# or: greater add faces/artist
```
