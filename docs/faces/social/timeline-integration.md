# Social Face: Timeline Integration

## Components

The social face includes multiple timeline implementations (including virtualized timelines) and patterns for thread views.

## Recommended approach

- Start by importing from `@equaltoai/greater-components/faces/social`.
- Use the Lesser adapter + stores for loading/pagination when integrating with a Lesser GraphQL backend.

## Examples

- Example app: `examples/social-app`
- Core patterns: `docs/core-patterns.md`
