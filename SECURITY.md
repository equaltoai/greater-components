3. **Response Time**: We will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
4. **Updates**: Regular updates on investigation progress

### PGP Public Key

For sensitive vulnerability reports, encrypt your message with our PGP key:

```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
[PGP key would go here in real implementation]
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

1. **Component/Package**: Which Greater Components package is affected
2. **Version**: Specific version number where vulnerability exists
3. **Vulnerability Type**: XSS, CSRF, injection, etc.
4. **Impact Assessment**: Potential impact and severity
5. **Reproduction Steps**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
6. **Proof of Concept**: Code example demonstrating the vulnerability
7. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue
8. **Disclosure Timeline**: Your preferred disclosure timeline

### Example Report Template

```
Subject: [SECURITY] Vulnerability in @greater/primitives Modal component

Component: @greater/primitives Modal
Version: 1.0.5
Severity: High
Type: XSS vulnerability

Description:
The Modal component is vulnerable to XSS attacks when rendering 
user-provided content in the title prop without proper sanitization.

Impact:
An attacker could inject malicious scripts that execute in the 
context of the application, potentially accessing user data or 
performing unauthorized actions.

Reproduction:
1. Import Modal from @greater/primitives
2. Set title prop to: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`
3. Open the modal
4. JavaScript alert executes

Suggested Fix:
Sanitize the title prop before rendering, or use textContent 
instead of innerHTML for title rendering.

Proof of Concept:
[Code example here]
```
