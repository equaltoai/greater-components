# Introducing Greater Components v1.0.0: Production-Ready UI Components for the Fediverse

**August 11, 2025** ‚Äî Today marks a significant milestone in Fediverse development tooling. After months of development, testing, and community feedback, we're thrilled to announce the **v1.0.0 release of Greater Components** ‚Äî the first comprehensive UI component library specifically designed for building modern, accessible Fediverse applications.

## üéâ What is Greater Components?

Greater Components is a complete UI toolkit that provides everything developers need to build engaging social media experiences on the Fediverse. Built with **Svelte 5's revolutionary runes system**, **TypeScript**, and **accessibility-first principles**, it offers:

- **10 essential primitive components** (Button, Modal, TextField, Menu, Tooltip, Tabs, Avatar, Skeleton, ThemeSwitcher, ThemeProvider)
- **Specialized Fediverse components** (StatusCard, TimelineVirtualized, NotificationsFeed, ComposeBox)
- **300+ SVG icons** including Fediverse-specific icons like boost, favorite, and reply
- **Comprehensive design tokens** with light, dark, and high-contrast themes
- **Real-time streaming support** with WebSocket and Server-Sent Events
- **Protocol adapters** for Mastodon, Pleroma, and generic ActivityPub servers
- **Testing utilities** with accessibility helpers and visual regression tools

## üöÄ Why We Built This

The Fediverse ecosystem has incredible potential, but developers have been building UI components from scratch for each project. This leads to:

- **Inconsistent user experiences** across different Fediverse applications
- **Repeated accessibility work** with each new client or tool
- **Slower development cycles** due to reinventing common patterns
- **Barriers to entry** for new developers wanting to build Fediverse apps

Greater Components solves these problems by providing battle-tested, accessible components that work seamlessly across the entire Fediverse ecosystem.

## ‚≠ê Key Features That Make v1.0.0 Special

### üé® **Production-Ready Design System**

```css
/* Easy theming with design tokens */
:root {
  --gr-color-primary-600: #6366f1; /* Your brand color */
  --gr-radii-lg: 12px; /* Consistent border radius */
}

.gr-button--solid {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
}
```

Greater Components includes a complete design system with:
- **Systematic color palettes** with semantic token mappings
- **Typography scales** optimized for social media content
- **Spacing system** that maintains visual hierarchy
- **Three built-in themes** (light, dark, high-contrast) with WCAG compliance

### ‚ôø **Accessibility Without Compromise**

Every component is built with accessibility as a first-class concern:

```svelte
<!-- Screen readers get comprehensive context -->
<Button 
  variant="solid" 
  disabled={isSubmitting}
  aria-describedby="submit-help"
>
  {#if isSubmitting}
    <LoadingSpinner aria-hidden="true" />
  {/if}
  {isSubmitting ? 'Posting...' : 'Post'}
</Button>
```

- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** across all components
- **Full keyboard navigation** with logical tab order and shortcuts
- **Screen reader optimization** with proper ARIA attributes
- **Focus management** for complex interactions like modals
- **High contrast theme** that exceeds WCAG AAA requirements
- **Reduced motion support** respecting user preferences

### ‚ö° **Svelte 5 Performance**

Built on Svelte 5's cutting-edge runes system for optimal performance:

```svelte
<script>
  // Reactive state with fine-grained updates
  let posts = $state([]);
  let filteredPosts = $derived(posts.filter(post => !post.muted));
  
  // Effects for side effects
  $effect(() => {
    if (posts.length > 1000) {
      // Only update when crossing threshold
      console.log('Large timeline detected, enabling virtualization');
    }
  });
</script>
```

- **Zero runtime overhead** with compile-time optimizations
- **Fine-grained reactivity** updates only what changed
- **Tree-shakeable exports** to minimize bundle size
- **Virtual scrolling** for handling thousands of social media posts

### üåê **Fediverse-Native Components**

Purpose-built components for social media applications:

```svelte
<script>
  import { StatusCard, TimelineVirtualized } from '@greater/fediverse';
  import { createTimelineStore } from '@greater/fediverse';
  
  // Real-time timeline with automatic updates
  const timeline = createTimelineStore({
    server: 'mastodon.social',
    timeline: 'public:local',
    realtime: true
  });
</script>

<TimelineVirtualized 
  items={$timeline.items}
  onLoadMore={timeline.loadMore}
  onLike={timeline.like}
  onBoost={timeline.boost}
  onReply={timeline.reply}
/>
```

- **StatusCard** with rich content rendering, media attachments, and action buttons
- **TimelineVirtualized** for performant rendering of thousands of posts
- **NotificationsFeed** with intelligent grouping and real-time updates
- **ComposeBox** with media uploads, polls, and privacy controls
- **Real-time streaming** that works across different Fediverse servers

## üì¶ Complete Package Ecosystem

Greater Components is organized into focused packages that work together seamlessly:

### Core Foundation
- **@greater/primitives** ‚Äî Essential UI building blocks
- **@greater/tokens** ‚Äî Design system tokens and theming
- **@greater/icons** ‚Äî Comprehensive icon library

### Specialized Tools

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Experience

### **TypeScript-First Development**

```typescript
import type { ButtonProps, StatusCardProps } from '@greater/primitives';

// Full type safety for all component props
const buttonConfig: ButtonProps = {
  variant: 'solid', // Autocomplete suggests: 'solid' | 'outline' | 'ghost'
  size: 'md',       // Autocomplete suggests: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'
  disabled: false
};
```

- **Complete TypeScript definitions** for all components and utilities
- **Intelligent autocomplete** in VS Code and other editors  
- **Compile-time error checking** prevents runtime issues
- **Prop inference** from component imports

### **Comprehensive Documentation**

Every public API includes detailed JSDoc documentation:

```typescript
/**
 * Modal component - Accessible dialog with focus management and backdrop handling.
 * 
 * @param open - Controls whether the modal is open or closed (bindable)
