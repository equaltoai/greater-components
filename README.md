# Greater Components

> AGPL-licensed Fediverse UI components built with Svelte 5, TypeScript, and pnpm workspaces

- **TypeScript Strict**: Full type safety and excellent developer experience
- **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant components with full keyboard and screen reader support
- **Design Tokens**: Flexible theming system with light, dark, and high-contrast modes
- **Real-time Ready**: WebSocket-first architecture with automatic fallbacks
- **Monorepo Structure**: Organized packages for tokens, icons, primitives, and Fediverse-specific components
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Vitest, Storybook, and Playwright for reliable components
