Task 1B Completed: `packages/adapters` Coverage Improvement

**Summary of Changes:**

1.  **`src/mappers/lesser/mappers.ts`**:
    -   Created `packages/adapters/src/mappers/lesser/__tests__/mappers.test.ts`.
    -   Added comprehensive tests for `mapLesserAccount`, `mapLesserPost`, `mapLesserNotification`, `mapLesserObject`, `mapLesserStreamingUpdate` and batch mappers.
    -   Covered all major entity types (status, notification, account) and edge cases (partial data, errors).

2.  **`src/stores/unifiedToTimeline.ts`**:
    -   Created `packages/adapters/src/stores/__tests__/unifiedToTimeline.test.ts`.
    -   Tested conversion of unified statuses to timeline items, including handling of "tombstones" (deleted items) and all optional Lesser metadata fields.

3.  **`src/stores/fetchHelpers.ts`**:
    -   Created `packages/adapters/src/stores/__tests__/fetchHelpers.test.ts`.
    -   Tested `fetchTimelinePage` and `fetchNotificationPage` with mocks for the GraphQL adapter.
    -   Covered all timeline sources (home, local, federated, direct, list, hashtag, actor) and pagination logic.

4.  **`src/graphql/LesserGraphQLAdapter.ts`**:
    -   Created `packages/adapters/src/graphql/__tests__/LesserGraphQLAdapter.test.ts`.
    -   Replaced the basic `verifyCredentials.test.ts` with a full suite covering the entire adapter class.
    -   Added tests for `uploadMedia` (including `FormData` construction), error handling helpers, and all query/mutation/subscription wrappers.

5.  **`src/stores/timelineStore.ts`**:
    -   Updated `packages/adapters/src/stores/__tests__/timelineStore.test.ts`.
    -   Added tests for:
        -   Initial load state.
        -   Pagination (`loadMore`, `refresh`) with async debounce handling.
        -   Optimistic updates (`addItem`, `replaceItem`, `deleteItem`).
        -   Streaming event handling (`timelineUpdates`, `quoteActivity`, etc.).
        -   Lesser-specific filters (`getItemsWithCost`, `getModeratedItems`, etc.).
        -   Virtual window updates.

**Outcome:**
All created tests are passing. The coverage for `packages/adapters` should now be well above the 80% target for the focused files, closing the ~914 branch and ~853 line deficit identified in the task.
