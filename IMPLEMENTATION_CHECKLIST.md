### greater-components: Phased Implementation Checklist

Use this checklist to drive execution of the repository plan. Items are grouped by rollout phase and further by package/component. Each task is actionable and verifiable. Check off items as you complete them.

Note on conventions
- All UI is Svelte 5 (runes), TypeScript-strict.
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) is required for all public components.
- Tests: Vitest unit + Storybook 9 CT + Playwright visual/interaction + axe checks.
- Versioning: Changesets, semantic versioning, automated releases.
