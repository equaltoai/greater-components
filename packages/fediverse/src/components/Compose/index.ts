/**
 * Compose Compound Component
 * 
 * A flexible, composable compose/post creation component for ActivityPub/Fediverse apps.
 * Built using compound component pattern with support for media, content warnings, and visibility settings.
 * 
 * @example Basic usage
 * ```svelte
 * <script>
 *   import { Compose } from '@greater/fediverse';
 *   
 *   async function handleSubmit(data) {
 *     await api.statuses.create(data);
 *   }
 * </script>
 * 
 * <Compose.Root handlers={{ onSubmit: handleSubmit }}>
 *   <Compose.Editor autofocus />
 *   <Compose.CharacterCount />
 *   <Compose.VisibilitySelect />
 *   <Compose.Submit />
 * </Compose.Root>
 * ```
 * 
 * @example With reply
 * ```svelte
 * <Compose.Root
 *   initialState={{ inReplyTo: status.id }}
 *   handlers={{ onSubmit: handleReply }}
 * >
 *   <Compose.Editor />
 *   <Compose.Submit text="Reply" />
 * </Compose.Root>
 * ```
 * 
 * @module @greater/fediverse/Compose
